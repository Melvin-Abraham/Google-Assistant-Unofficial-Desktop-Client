## Getting Started

In order to use the client, you must have a _"Key File"_ and _"Token"_ for authentication which you can get by going through **Device Registration** process. You can go through the wiki given below to get started.

"*Setup Authentication for Google Assistant Unofficial Desktop Client*" Wiki (For both **Device Registration** & **Authentication** help):
> https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/wiki/Setup-Authentication-for-Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client

#### Other References

If you want a user friendly registration method, use **Device Registration** UI:
> https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/library/python/embed/config-dev-project-and-account

If you want to use a CLI tool to complete the **Device Registration** and **Authentication** process manually, read the following:
> https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/reference/device-registration/register-device-manual

After you have registered your device and downloaded the required authentication files, you can head on to _Settings_ and set the _"Key File Path"_ and _"Saved Tokens Path"_ to the location where the respective files are located.
