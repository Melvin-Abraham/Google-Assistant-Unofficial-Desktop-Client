        Please include a list of what the feature should and shouldn't do by filling in the table below.

        'Must' implies that the feature should not ship without this capability.
        'Should' is something we should push hard for, but is not absolutely required to ship.
        'Could' is a nice-to-have; a good stretch goal that isn't painful if we don't achieve it.
        'Won't' is a clear statement that the proposal/feature will intentionally not have that capability.
